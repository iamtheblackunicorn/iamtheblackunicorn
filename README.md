# The Black Unicorn :unicorn: :black_heart:

## About me :books:

Hello! I am Alexander Abraham, also known as "The Black Unicorn". I am a self-taught developer and designer from Vienna, Austria.
The technologies that I specialise in are web-development, app-development using the Flutter framework, and developing websites
that rely on databases in SQLite or PostgreSQL using the Django Framework. I started learning the Python programming language at
a very young age and recently taught myself the Dart programming language. I have developed and I maintain some open-source Dart packages on the Dart package index, pub.dev. All apps and website I have completed share three characteristics that I hold in very high regard and take great care to observe in everything I do. These three characteristics are: Elegance, Speed, and Beauty.
